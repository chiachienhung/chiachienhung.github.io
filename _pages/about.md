Hello, I'm Chia-Chien üëã

I am a PhD student at [UMANLP](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/focus-groups/natural-language-processing-and-information-retrieval-prof-ponzetto/) of [Data and Web Science Group](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/) at <em>University of Mannheim, Germany</em>. I am working in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** field under the supervision of [Pr. Simone Paolo Ponzetto](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-simone-paolo-ponzetto/) and [Pr. Goran Glava≈°](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas). My research interests are **multilingual and multi-domain conversational AI**, focusing on domain and language specialization methods for dialog systems with the concerns of *efficient* domain- and language-transfer techniques. 

Besides academic experience, bridging the gap between research and practice is one of my goals to achieve. I was involved in an industrial project [Multi2ConvAI](https://sites.google.com/inovex.de/multi2conv/) funded by [BW Ministry of Business](https://wm.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/startseite/) with two companies: [inovex](https://www.inovex.de/de/) and [Neohelden](https://neohelden.com/). The project is aimed at bringing cutting-edge representation and transfer learning models to commercial conversational AI systems. The overall project is packed in a python package: [multi2convai](https://github.com/chiachienhung/multi2convai).
    
I enjoy outdoor activities: camping üèïÔ∏è , hiking ‚õ∞Ô∏è , scuba diving ü§ø . This year, I challenge myself to learn Ukulele, and also join a full marathon üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è in September. Feel free to get in touch with me by [email](chia-chien@informatik.uni-mannheim.de).
