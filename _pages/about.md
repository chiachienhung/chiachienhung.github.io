Hello, I'm Chia-Chien 👋 

I am a research scientist in <a href="https://neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai"><i>Human-Centric AI (HAI) Group</i></a> at NEC Labs Europe. My research focuses on adapting generative AI-driven solutions for healthcare applications, while ensuring safety and trustworthiness. I am passionate about bridging the gap between research and practice, and developing AI systems that are impactful and responsible.
I earned my PhD from <em>University of Mannheim, Germany</em> in December 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Simone Paolo Ponzetto](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-simone-paolo-ponzetto/) and [Prof. Goran Glavaš](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas). My doctoral research explored domain and language specialization methods with the concerns of efficient domain- and language-transfer techniques. 

Besides my work, I enjoy outdoor activities: camping 🏕️ , hiking ⛰️ , scuba diving 🤿 . I’ve completed full marathons 🏃‍♀️ in Berlin (2022) and Athens (2023), with more adventures on the horizon!
