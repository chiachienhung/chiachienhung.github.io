Hello, I'm Chia-Chien. 

I am a PhD student at [DWS-NLP Group](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/focus-groups/natural-language-processing-and-information-retrieval-prof-ponzetto/) at <em>University of Mannheim, Germany<em>. I am working in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** field under the supervision of [Pr. Simone Paolo Ponzetto](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-simone-paolo-ponzetto/) and [Pr. Goran Glava≈°](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas). My research topics are mainly focused on **multilingual and multi-domain conversational AI**, focusing on domain and language specialization methods for dialog systems and the concerns of domain- and language-transfer techniques.
    

    
This year, I challenge myself to learn Ukulele, and also join a full marathon in September 2022.
