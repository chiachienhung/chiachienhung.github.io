Hello, I'm Chia-Chien 👋

I am a research scientist of <a href="https://neclab.eu/research-areas/data-science/human-centric-ai"><i>Human-Centric AI (HAI)</i> at NEC Labs Europe</a> and a PhD student at [UMANLP](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/research/focus-groups/natural-language-processing-and-information-retrieval-prof-ponzetto/) of [Data and Web Science Group](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/) at <em>University of Mannheim, Germany</em>. I am working in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** field under the supervision of [Prof. Simone Paolo Ponzetto](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/people/professors/prof-dr-simone-paolo-ponzetto/) and [Prof. Goran Glavaš](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas). My research interests are domain and language specialization methods with the concerns of *efficient* domain- and language-transfer techniques. 

Besides academic experience, bridging the gap between research and practice is one of my goals to achieve. I was involved in an industrial project [Multi2ConvAI](https://sites.google.com/inovex.de/multi2conv/) funded by [BW Ministry of Business](https://wm.baden-wuerttemberg.de/de/startseite/) during my PhD with two companies: [inovex](https://www.inovex.de/de/) and [Neohelden](https://neohelden.com/). The project is aimed at bringing cutting-edge representation and transfer learning models to commercial conversational AI systems. The overall project is packed in a python package: [multi2convai](https://github.com/chiachienhung/multi2convai).
    
I enjoy outdoor activities: camping 🏕️ , hiking ⛰️ , scuba diving 🤿 . I completed my first full marathon 🏃‍♀️ in September 2022.
